# gomori (Rust library)

Game logic and tools for writing gomori bots. There is also a crate that implements the main loop for you: [gomori_bot_utils](../gomori_bot_utils).

See `cargo doc --open` for documentation. There is also an [online version](https://nnmm.github.io/docs/gomori) (+ for [gomori_bot_utils](https://nnmm.github.io/docs/gomori_bot_utils)), but it is not automatically updated, so might get outdated.
